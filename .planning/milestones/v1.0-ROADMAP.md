# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-20
**Phases:** 1
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Pedantic Parakeet delivers high-quality audio transcription for Apple Silicon. Phase 1 established multi-backend support with a curated model registry. The v1.0 MVP requirements are complete — the tool is production-ready for transcription workflows.

## Phases

### Phase 1: mlx-audio Backend Support

**Goal**: Enable transcription using multiple MLX backends with capability-based validation
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: BACK-01, BACK-02, BACK-03, BACK-04, BACK-05, OUT-06, LANG-03, CLI-05, QA-01, QA-02
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Backend capability contracts and curated model registry
- [x] 01-02: Parakeet and mlx-audio backend adapters with factory wiring
- [x] 01-03: CLI flags, validation, tests, and documentation

**Success Criteria** (all verified):
1. ✓ User can list curated models showing backend and capability info
2. ✓ User can select backend with `--backend` and models with `--model` or aliases
3. ✓ Text-only models (Voxtral) reject srt/vtt/json formats with clear error
4. ✓ Language bias options are validated against model capabilities
5. ✓ Backend registry and CLI validation have test coverage

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Protocol-based backend interface for duck-typing flexibility
- Extract types to types.py to resolve circular imports
- Model aliases in registry for CLI convenience
- Lazy mlx-audio import to allow module import without optional dependency

**Issues Resolved:**
- Circular import between transcriber.py and backends (resolved via types.py extraction)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
